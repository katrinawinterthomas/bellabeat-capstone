# Bellabeat Capstone – Google Data Analytics Certificate  
**Author:** Katrina Winter Thomas  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This capstone project explores Fitbit user data to help Bellabeat, a smart wellness tech company, make data-driven marketing decisions. I applied the full data analysis process—ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act—to uncover user behavior patterns related to activity, sleep, and calorie burn.

## 🧰 Tools Used  
- Excel  
- SQL  
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Tableau  
- Google Slides  

## 📈 Key Insights  
- Users who consistently track their activity and sleep burn more calories.  
- Those averaging 7+ hours of sleep show higher engagement and better wellness metrics.  
- Bellabeat can benefit from user reminders, gamification, and personalized insights.

## ✅ Recommendations  
- Promote sleep tracking through app-based education.  
- Add streak tracking and milestone rewards to improve user retention.  
- Launch push notifications for daily steps and sleep reminders.
